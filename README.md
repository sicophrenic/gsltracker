# WELCOME TO GSLTRACKER
---

######Goal: Create a simple, intuitive, easy to use resource for keeping up with GSL (and GSTL) results by combining data from GomTV.net and Liquipedia not just for tournaments but their players as well.

######Motivation: GOMTV's "Results" page is a simple Google Spreadsheet with the tournament results; Liquipedia's large set of data is readily available, but navigating the site can be extremely cumbersome and difficult. GSLTracker attempts to get the best of both worlds (GOMTV and Liquipedia) in a central location.

######Info: GSLTracker is built with Ruby on Rails with multiple JS extensions with resources and data attained from GOMTV, Liquipedia, and Blizzard Entertainment/Starcraft II. Currently included libraries include Highcharts (JS) for a clean graphical display of many tournament/player/team/race/map statistics.
